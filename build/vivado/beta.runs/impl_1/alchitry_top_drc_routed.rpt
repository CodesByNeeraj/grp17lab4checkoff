REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 beta_manual/motherboard/memory_unit/data_memory/mem_reg has an input control pin beta_manual/motherboard/memory_unit/data_memory/mem_reg/WEBWE[0] (net: beta_manual/motherboard/memory_unit/data_memory/WEBWE[0]) which is driven by a register (reset_cond/D_stage_q_reg[3]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
